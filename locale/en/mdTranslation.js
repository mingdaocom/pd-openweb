    "（3）在打印 Excel 模板时，多张图片排列可能导致撑高合并单元格引起错位，此时可以加 F 启用图片填充模式，此模式下图片不会撑高单元格，例如：#{附件$[auto*20_F]$} 或 #{附件$[auto*90_HF]$}": "When printing Excel template, multiple picture arrangement may cause misalignment caused by overheight merging cells.

By using the code #{[qrcode]字段名$[20*20]$} or #{[barcode]字段名$[40*10]$}, you can generate a QR code or barcode for any field.

    "7. 批量打印 Word 模板时，默认所有数据连续打印，如需实现分页功能（每条数据另起一页），需在模板中的第一个段落配置段前分页。设置方法可参考": "7. When printing Word templates in batches, by default, all data is printed continuously. If you need to implement pagination (start each data on a new page), you should configure the page break before the first paragraph in the template. Refer to the provided method for setup.",

    "建立用户扩展信息表": "Create User’s Extended Information Table",
    "什么是用户扩展信息表？": "What is the User Extended Information Table?",
    "用户扩展信息表非常类似于组织中的用户管理表。在组织中，可以全局管理成员基础信息，如：部门、职位、组织角色等。其中部门、组织角色可用于数据权限范围，在工作表添加部门字段，可以使用户对自己所在部门的记录都拥有权限。同样在具体应用中，往往也需要额外管理用户在本应用中的扩展信息。如：销售管理应用中，需要管理销售人员所在的团队、区域、职能等，同时也希望这些信息可以类似部门一样用于数据权限范围。此时就可以建立一张销售人员表。": "The table for user extended information bears a strong resemblance to the user management table within an organization. In an organization, it's possible to manage basic member information such as department, position, and organizational role on a global scale. Both department and organizational roles can be utilized for data permission scopes. By adding a department field to the worksheet, users can have access to all records within their respective departments. Similarly, in specific applications, there's often a need to manage additional user information within the application. For instance, in sales management applications, there's a need to manage details such as the team, region, and function of sales personnel. It's also desirable for this information to be used in the scope of data permissions, similar to the department. In such cases, a table for sales personnel can be created.",
    "什么是权限标签？": "What are permission tags?",
    "权限标签指用于控制数据权限范围的扩展信息字段（仅支持关联类型字段）。当用户访问应用时，系统可以从扩展信息表中读取当前用户的权限标签，从而使用户对其他工作表中关联了相同标签的记录拥有权限。": "Permission labels refer to extended information fields used to control the scope of data permissions (only associated type fields are supported). When a user accesses the application, the system can read the current user's permission tag from the Extended Information table so that the user has permissions to records in other worksheets that have the same tag associated with them.",
    "权限标签如何用于数据权限范围？": "How are permission tags used for data permission scopes?",
    "权限标签用于数据权限范围时和部门字段类似，只是没有专门的系统字段，需要通过关联记录字段来灵活实现。": "Permission labels are similar to departmental fields when used for data permission scopes, except that there is no dedicated system field, and they need to be flexibly implemented through associated record fields.",
    "如：还是在销售管理应用中，用户扩展信息表中已设置了团队作为用户权限标签（关联团队表），并且订单表也关联了所属团队时。那么当用户访问应用时，系统就可以根据读取到的用户所在团队，并从订单表中过滤出关联了相同团队的订单，从而实现用户对属于自己团队的订单拥有查看、编辑或删除权限（可以在角色权限中进行设置）。": "For example, in the sales management application, the team has been set as the user's permission tag in the user's extended information table (the associated team table), and the order table has been associated with the team to which the user belongs. Then when the user accesses the application, the system can read the user's team, and from the order table to filter out the orders associated with the same team, so as to realise that the user belongs to their own team's orders have view, edit or delete permissions (can be set in the role permissions).",

    "创建索引时如何选择索引字段？": "How to select index fields when creating indexes?",
    "在视图、筛选、快速筛选等查询场景中被检索的字段或者在视图、子表、关联记录中被排序的字段才需要创建索引。": "Only fields retrieved in queries like views, filters, or sorted in views, sub-tables, or associated records need indexes.",
    "选择索引字段时请记住一个原则：记录中重复值越少的字段，越适合建立索引。例如一个不允许重复的「商品编号」字段，就非常适合创建索引；反之，一个用于记录男、女的「性别」字段，则不适合创建索引。": "Fields with fewer duplicates are better for indexing. For instance, a unique \"item number\" field is ideal for indexing, while a \"gender\" field isn't.",
    "如果一些字段总是需要一起参与检索，它们组合起来之后的重复率更低，例如「First Name」和「Last Name」，那么你可以同时选择这两个字段创建一个复合索引，比为这两个字段分别创建索引效果更好。": "If fields like \"First Name\" and \"Last Name\" are often searched together and have less duplication when combined, you can create a compound index for them, which is more effective than separate indexes.",
    "索引字段排序有什么用？": "What is the use of index field sorting?",
    "索引字段的排序和你在视图中使用此字段参与排序的规则有关。当索引只有一个字段时，视图中排序的方向不会影响检索的加速；除此之外，请尽量保证在视图中的字段排序方式与索引中设置的一致，否则检索可能不会被加速。": "The sorting of an index field depends on the sorting rules in the view. If the index has one field, the view's sort direction won't affect retrieval speed. However, if not, ensure the view's field sorting matches the index to maintain retrieval speed.",
    "为什么索引会创建失败？": "Why does index creation fail?",
    "创建索引时，会有下列限制，不遵循限制可能会出现索引创建失败的情况：": "Failure to follow these index creation restrictions may result in failure.",
    "○ 创建「唯一索引」时，选择的索引字段在已有记录里不能存在重复值；": "o When creating a \"unique index\", the selected index field cannot have duplicate values in existing records.",
    "○ 创建索引时选择的字段不能和之前已创建的某个索引的字段完全一样；": "o the fields selected when creating an index cannot be exactly the same as the fields of a previously created index.",
    "○ 一张工作表只能创建一个「文本索引」或「所有文本字段全文索引」；": "o Only one \"text index\" or \"full text index of all text fields\" can be created for a worksheet.",
    "○ 一个索引只能包含一个「选项」类型的字段，如单选\/多选\/人员\/部门等；": "o An index can only contain one \"option\" type field, such as single\/multiple select\/person\/department, etc.",
    "索引越多越好吗？": "Is more indexing better?",
    "并非如此。索引只会加速检索，而在新增、更新、删除记录时系统会花费更多的时间用于更新索引，过多的索引会很明显的降低这些操作的速度，甚至影响到查询的速度。": "No, indexing speeds up retrieval but slows down record changes due to index updates. Excessive indexing can even affect query speed.",
    "系统会自动为我建立索引吗？": "Will the system automatically create an index for me?",
    "是的，我们会根据公有云平台每天的访问日志，自动学习和智能分析被频繁使用的查询语句，并自动创建合适的索引。所以，请不要随意修改和删除不是由你自己创建的索引。私有部署环境暂不支持自动创建索引。": "Yes, we auto-analyze frequently used queries from public cloud logs and create indexes. Please don't alter indexes not created by you. Auto-indexing isn't supported in private environments.",
